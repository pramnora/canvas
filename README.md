# HTML Canvas
HTML Canvas program code

## NOTES

### NOTE(1):

The use of HTML Canvas...uses both a mixture of HTML/Javascript to work, effectively; the use of CSS is entirely optional, instead. 

You can either choose to create 2/or, 3 seperate files:
- fileName.html
- fileName.js
- fileName.css  

...or else, you could choose to include all HTML/Javascript/CSS code inside of one single [.html] document file instead.  

### NOTE(2):

Remember that order is important... First, you write the HTML Canvas code...; by declaring the 2 open/close 'canvas tags'.
Next, you write the Javascript below the pair of HTML 'canvas tags'...; otherwise, your script might encounter errors such as: object not found/can't initialize variables...?!

### NOTE(3):

Web browsers such as IE 8.1, and, older...may not be able to understand how to read HTML 5 canvas tag code; therefore, it's necessary to include in between the pair of open/close canvas tags a message stating... 
'Your browser does not understand the HTML 5 canvas tag.'
...browsers that do understand will NOT display the message; only browsers that don't understand.
