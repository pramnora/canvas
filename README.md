# HTML Canvas
HTML Canvas program code

## NOTES

The use of HTML Canvas...uses both a mixture of HTML/Javascript to work, effectively; the use of CSS is entirely optional, instead. 

You can either choose to create 2/or, 3 seperate files:
- fileName.html
- fileName.js
- fileName.css  

...or else, you could choose to include all HTML/Javascript/CSS code inside of one single [.html] document file instead.
