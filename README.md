# HTML Canvas
HTML Canvas program code

## NOTES

### NOTE(1):

The use of HTML Canvas...uses both a mixture of HTML/Javascript to work, effectively; the use of CSS is entirely optional, instead. 

You can either choose to create 2/or, 3 seperate files:
- fileName.html
- fileName.js
- fileName.css  

...or else, you could choose to include all HTML/Javascript/CSS code inside of one single [.html] document file instead.  

### NOTE(2):

First, you write the HTML Canvas code...; by declaring the 2 open/close 'canvas' tags
Next, you write the Javascript below the pair of HTML 'canvas tags'...otherwise, your script might encounter errors such as: object not found/can't initialize variables...?!

### NOTE(3):

It's a good idea to include a message saying: 'Your browser does not understand the HTML 5 canvass tag.' which is written in between the pair of open/close 'canvas tags'; as not all browsers will understand it, especially, if older.
